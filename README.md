- [Github actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions): is now very mature can help automate some of the things I collected on GitHub and replace old CI systems. Especially it can be used for [ML operations](https://github.blog/2020-06-17-using-github-actions-for-mlops-data-science/), [YouTube cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll50l3fsoYs)

The [Deep learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) tries to be framework agnostic, but you might be interested to do the online courses from Google about using [Tensorflow in production as well after](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp).
