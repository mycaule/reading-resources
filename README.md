#### Things to watch in 2020

##### Online courses

- [x] [Stéphane Mallat @ Collège de France - Modèles multi-échelles et réseaux de neurones convolutifs](https://www.college-de-france.fr/site/stephane-mallat/course-2019-2020.htm): third consecutive year of expert class to be held weekly about Deep Learning
- [x] [Deep Learning courses at MIT 2020](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/), the introduction course State of the Art is the most interesting one every year

#### Videos and Blog posts collection

##### February 2020

- [x] [`photoprism/photoprism`](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism): Photo Management app powered by Go and TensorFlow. 
Long-term goal to become an open platform for machine learning research based on real-world photo collections.
- [x] [Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-deployment-scenarios-tensorflow)

##### January 2020

- [x] [Laurence Moroney @ Google - Serverless Machine Learning with Tensorflow (course 4 of Data Engineering specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/serverless-machine-learning-gcp?specialization=gcp-data-machine-learning). [Course 3 about Dataflow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/serverless-data-analysis-bigquery-cloud-dataflow-gcp?specialization=gcp-data-machine-learning) is also interesting, _ie._ from _Apache Spark_ to _Apache Beam_ like [Spotify did](https://github.com/spotify/scio).
- [x] [Jeff Dean @ Spark Submit - Large Scale Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYwIDn00PAo) about convincing the Spark community to use Tensorflow
- [x] [Laurence Moroney @ Google - Recommendation Systems with TensorFlow on GCP (course 5 of Tensorflow specialization)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommendation-models-gcp)
- [x] [naphta / tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js)
- [x] [ActiveState/gococo](https://github.com/ActiveState/gococo) contains interesting instructions to load a SavedModel directly from a Go application
- [x] [hwalsuklee/awesome-deep-text-detection-recognition](https://github.com/hwalsuklee/awesome-deep-text-detection-recognition): latest advances in text detection and recognition with open source implementations
- [x] Using a similar Tensorflow approach at Airbnb : [1](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/categorizing-listing-photos-at-airbnb-f9483f3ab7e3), [2](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e)
- [x] [TensorFlow: Data and Deployment DeepLearning.AI specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/tensorflow-data-and-deployment/): course #1 on training and running Tensorflow.js is usable for a rearchitecture, course #2, week2 on running TFLite from Kotlin in the JVM is a way to reuse SavedModels without Tensorflow Serving
- [x] [Lex Friedman @ MIT - Deep Learning State of the Art 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VH1Lim8gL8)
- [x] [Zillow - Improving the home selling & buying experience by containerizing ML deployments](https://www.zillow.com/tech/containerizing-ml-deployments/)
- [x] [Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-pipelines-tensorflow)
- [x] [Rakuten multi-model classifier](http://www.college-de-france.fr/video/stephane-mallat/2020/05-sem-mallat-challenge-rakuten-20200122.mp4)
- [x] [Vox - AI can help find illegal opioid sellers online](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/21/21060680/opioids-artificial-intelligence-illegal-online-pharmacies)

##### December 2019

- [x] [Andrew Ng @ Deeplearning.AI - Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3qpIzy4MQk&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b&index=5) videos 5 to 7 on train/dev/test sets. The [Deep learning specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/) tries to be framework agnostic, but you might be interested to do the online courses from Google about using [Tensorflow in production as well after](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/advanced-machine-learning-tensorflow-gcp).
- [x] [Andrew Ng @ Stanford - Full-Cycle Deep Learning Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUJNGv_sb4Y)
- [x] [Kubeflow on AWS](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/aws/)

##### November 2019

- [x] [Tencent ML Images / Dictionary and semantic hierarchy](https://github.com/Tencent/tencent-ml-images/blob/master/data/dictionary_and_semantic_hierarchy.txt)
- [x] [Tensorflow / TensorFlow Serving with Docker](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/docker) and [AWS Deep Learning AMI / Tensorflow Serving](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/tutorial-tfserving.html) to have alternatives ways to run Tensorflow serving locally or on AWS
- [x] [TensorBoard.dev](https://tensorboard.dev/) to share experiments results with stakeholders and project managers.
- [x] [Chrome Extension - URL Rewriter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/url-rewriter/gpbblpbcnjdnnjdcdclojoonfmpoionh)
